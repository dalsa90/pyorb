PyORB (Python Optimized Reduced Basis) is a set of Python scripts for the use of reduced basis method. The code is designed to rely on a third party library for the Full Order Model (FOM) approximation of the PDE, which can be either implemented in MATLAB or C. In order to employ any third party library (TPL), an external engine is implemented in pyorb_core/tpl_managers. Such engine requires that the actual implementations of functions required for the offline phase of the RB method are found in the TPL which is provided in the main through a path.

Current tests included in the library in the folder examples/ take into account either the MATLAB TPL [`feamat`](https://github.com/lucapegolotti/feamat) or the C++ TPL [`LifeV`](https://www.lifev.org).

PyORB is mainly conceived, developed and maintained by [Niccol√≤ Dal Santo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niccolo-dal-santo/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/).
